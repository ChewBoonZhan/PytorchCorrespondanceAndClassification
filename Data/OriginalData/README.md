## Setup for data to be used for Preprocessing

1. Go to [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O6xmoHd7FSzKQPwPTLaAt1ABB8oZL-iz?usp=sharing) to download 2 folders called "BBOX_Record" and "Multiview_jpg". 

2. Extract the data here, in this format:
<br /><br />
<img src = "./Image/1.png" height=300 />
<br />
As can be seen from image above, "BBOX_Record" and "Multiview_jpg" is to be extracted to OriginalData folder.
